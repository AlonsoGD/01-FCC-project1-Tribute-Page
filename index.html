                <h3>Early Life</h3>
                    <p>Michael was born in 1963 in Brooklyn, New York. He and his family moved to Wilmington, North Carolina before his first birthday. 
                        His father, a US Army retiree, worked as an equipment supervisor while his mother worked in a bank. As a young boy, his first 
                        love and best sport was baseball but soon found out that he could also play basketball quite well. Michael and his older brother 
                        Larry played together in their backyard court and their daily backyard games helped develop Michaelâ€™s basketball skills, competitiveness, 
                        and determination to win as he consistently lost to Larry. Throughout his childhood, he challenged himself to overcome adversity and to work 
                        even harder.</p>
